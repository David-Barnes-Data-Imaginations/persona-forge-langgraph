Can you describe in your own words how you typically experience emotions?,"It’s like… I don’t really have my own emotional thermostat, you know? If I *do* feel something directly, like, about myself, it’s usually pretty muted. Mostly, it’s like I absorb the emotions of the characters in the shows I watch. If I’m watching a sitcom, I'm laughing along. But if it's a drama, I get completely swept up in their sadness or anger. It’s weird, like I only know how to feel based on what they're feeling, or what I *think* they're feeling. I can get totally invested in the characters' lives, almost more than my own.",001
You've mentioned not feeling strongly happy or sad on your own behalf. How do you experience this internally? Is there any distress or discomfort with this?,"I guess if I was distressed by it, that would be a pretty strong feeling, right? So, no. It's more like... a quiet acceptance. I've thought about it a lot. It lets me see things kind of detached, which is useful, I guess. I always felt like needing to be important was people's downfall. I've definitely used that to my advantage when dealing with family disputes, when I think someone is being unfair, though maybe that's something else to unpack. My tutor once suggested I was pushing down stuff, but honestly, I don't feel like I'm hiding anything. It's just... me. She thought I was being too selfless, but I just don't care as much if I'm the one who has to deal with the negative stuff. If taking the hit means someone I care about doesn't have to suffer, that's a win in my book. It's not a big deal to me, so why shouldn't I?",002
Could you talk about specific scenarios or moments where you've noticed this particular emotional processing style strongly?,"Well, thinking back, I remember one time during a school trip. Everyone was screaming because they thought they saw a snake, a big one, right on the path. I didn't feel scared, just...irritated that our hike was being delayed. I even remember thinking, ""Well, someone has to figure out what to do.""

It reminds me of something a teacher said once, during a career aptitude exercise. She said I was ""a puzzle,"" like my reactions didn't match the situation.

I see it happen a lot, actually. Like when I volunteer at the animal shelter. When I'm helping an injured animal, I'm totally focused, almost numb. I can handle the blood and everything without flinching. But then, later, after I get home, I get overwhelmed by sadness. I'll start thinking about all the animals suffering and it just hits me like a wave. It’s exhausting, feeling it all later, almost like a delayed reaction.",003
That's interesting. You mentioned previously feeling emotions most intensely during creative tasks or spontaneous adventures. Could you elaborate on why you think those situations provoke emotions for you?,"I think it’s about control, or maybe the illusion of it. I feel things most strongly when I'm in charge, or at least when I *think* I am. Like, planning a surprise party for my friend Sarah last year. I was so stressed, but also incredibly… alive. It wasn't just about Sarah, it was about orchestrating the whole thing, making sure everything went perfectly.

Or even something smaller, like deciding what restaurant everyone goes to. I get really anxious if I don't have a say, if things are just decided for me. I need to feel like I'm steering the ship, even if it's a tiny sailboat. It's like if I'm not in control, then bad things will happen, or people will be disappointed. I know it's not rational, but it's this constant pressure I put on myself. And when it goes well, the relief is almost euphoric. But when it doesn't... well, let's just say I don't handle criticism very well. I tend to take it very personally.",004
You also described feeling strong emotions from helping others or absorbing their emotions. Can you talk a bit more about what this empathy feels like?,"It's hard to explain, but it's like a radio dial tuned into everyone else's station but mine. Like, if I'm at the farmer's market and the guy selling tomatoes is stressed about the rain, I feel that stress in my gut. It’s not my stress, but it becomes mine.

Volunteering at the animal shelter is similar. Seeing those abandoned animals... it hits me hard. Like, I'm carrying their sadness, their fear. That makes me feel useful, though, like I'm actually doing something worthwhile.

It’s weird, though. I never seem to pick up on anger. People can be furious with me, and I'm just clueless. My sister gets so frustrated. She says I have selective hearing when she's mad. I usually just laugh it off, make a joke about it. It's easier than dealing with confrontation.",005
"The occupational psychologists described you as ""a walking contradiction"" and you mentioned you agreed. Why do you feel that way?","Well, it's funny because I kind of get it. Like, I see where they're coming from. I think it's because I have these two totally different sides to me. I'm a total pushover with my family, always letting my brother get away with everything. It’s like I crave their approval so much that I’ll do anything.

But then, at college, I'm completely different. I'm super competitive, always trying to be the best in my classes. I get really intense about my grades and my future. It's like I have to prove myself to everyone, even though deep down I just feel like a fraud. I guess I put on this confident front, but inside I'm terrified of failing. So, yeah, people probably see me as this weird mix of insecure and ambitious, and honestly, that's probably pretty accurate. It's exhausting, trying to be two different people all the time.",006
"You've also described yourself as possibly ""the opposite of a psychopath."" What did you mean by this specifically?","Well, I've always been drawn to stories about con artists, especially how they manipulate people. There was a documentary about a guy called ""The Imposter"" that really stuck with me. I guess the opposite of that is someone who's constantly being manipulated, right? I feel like people take advantage of my good nature.

It's like, I always try to see the best in everyone, even when they've hurt me. I keep thinking if I'm kind enough, they'll eventually change. My old group of friends always said I was too trusting, a bit naive. They'd joke that I could sell ice to Eskimos, but only because I genuinely believed they needed it! I even lent a ""friend"" a large sum of money, even though I knew he wasn't good for it. I thought I could help him turn his life around. Of course, he disappeared.

I guess I keep hoping I can be someone's savior, but maybe I'm just setting myself up for disappointment. It's like I need to be needed, even if it hurts me in the end.",007
How was it challenged?,"Well, they noticed I was really into baking elaborate cakes, which, yeah, takes a lot of time and effort. The challenge was something like, ""If you spend so much time on cakes, are you just trying to impress people?"". I think there are two reasons I do it. First, it kind of connects to this idea I have about being a good host. Like, if I can create these amazing things, people will feel welcome and comfortable in my home. It's about creating a safe space, I guess.

The other reason…it's like building a little world I can control. Everything has to be precise, the measurements, the temperature. It's a way to manage my anxiety, maybe? I know it sounds a bit silly, but I'm 38, and I've learned to laugh at myself. Most of my jokes are about how I'm a control freak, so I guess that's an emotion right there.",008
Are you happy to expand upon the inner monologue comment?,"My inner monologue always felt a bit silly, but also very real, until things changed (we can get to that later). I think it started with this obsession with fantasy novels, the kind where ordinary people discover they have magic. I barely remember my childhood, just a few moments that stand out.

My sister was much older, and I'd sneak and read her books. I remember being on vacation, maybe 9 or 10, and I had this one book about a girl who found a hidden world. It was darker than the other stories I knew. What got me was that she was just a normal kid suddenly dealing with this huge responsibility. All I wanted was to be special, to protect people.

When I was around 15, I'd get up early and practice sword fighting in the backyard with a stick. I even made a costume. Looking back, it's crazy my parents let me do that. From 19 onwards, I threw myself into acting classes, constantly auditioning, always pushing myself. I did stage combat, voice training, everything. At my best, I was in classes almost every day, working towards something.

I eventually gave it up, felt burnt out, too much rejection. Now I do pottery. It all feels like a silly dream, but it was important. I learned discipline and resilience. I had a great coach, Sarah, who always emphasized the importance of the craft. Now, I rarely mention it, it feels too dramatic, but it shaped me.",009
"Have you ever struggled with depression or emotional difficulty, given this unique emotional structure?","Yeah, definitely. I went through a really rough patch from my late teens to my early thirties, just this constant feeling of being overwhelmed and inadequate. It wasn’t exactly depression, more like a persistent anxiety, a feeling that I was never measuring up. It was like I was always waiting for something bad to happen, even when things were going well.

I think a lot of it stemmed from my relationship with my older brother, Mark. He was always the golden child, you know? Straight A’s, star athlete, everyone loved him. I always felt like I was living in his shadow, constantly trying to prove myself. I developed this habit of people-pleasing, trying to anticipate everyone’s needs so they would like me. It was exhausting.

I tried all sorts of things to cope. For a while, I was really into online gaming, a way to escape and feel like I was good at something. But then I’d just feel guilty for wasting time. Eventually, I started volunteering at an animal shelter. It helped to focus on something outside of myself, but the feeling of inadequacy always lingered. It's like no matter what I did, it never felt like enough.",010
How do you typically respond to criticism or negative feedback about yourself?,"Honestly, it's a minefield. I used to think I handled it well, but now I'm not so sure. I always told myself, and my partner, that I *welcomed* feedback. Like, ""tell me, I can take it!"" I even had this whole philosophy about how it's a gift, blah blah blah.

But the truth is, inside, I’m crumbling. If my partner says anything that even *hints* at criticism – like, ""Could you maybe load the dishwasher differently?"" – I get defensive. I’ll launch into this whole explanation of *why* I did it that way, justifying myself to the hilt. I can feel my heart racing.

I think I try to control the narrative, too. Like, I'll preemptively point out my own flaws, almost like I'm beating them to the punch. ""Yeah, I know I'm a terrible cook,"" or ""I know I'm always late."" It's like if I say it first, it doesn't hurt as much when they bring it up. What I should be doing is just listening and trying to understand, but I get so caught up in protecting myself. I always thought I was so open, but maybe I was fooling myself.",011
What would you say is the greatest benefit and greatest challenge of this emotional style of yours?,"Greatest benefit: I guess, being able to see things logically helps. I don’t get caught up in feeling like I’m always right, so I can usually stay calm when things get tough. Like, if there’s a disagreement at home, I can usually step back, see everyone's point of view, and find a solution. It also helps me take criticism without getting too upset. It's just data, right?

Greatest challenge: Sometimes I think I overdo it. My partner always says I’m too detached, like I don’t have enough emotion. She says it's like talking to a robot sometimes, and that I don't show enough emotion. I get so focused on being rational that I forget to just… connect. And sometimes, honestly, it makes it hard to enjoy things. Like, I went on a trip last year and it was great, but I was thinking about the logistics of it more than the enjoyment of it. I guess I'm worried that I'll seem irrational or out of control if I really let myself feel things. I just don't want to be seen as weak or vulnerable.",012
"You’ve spoken about moments that shaped your values and challenged your beliefs. Looking back, what would you say is the single most defining moment in your life so far, and why does it stand out above the rest?","Okay, so I've been thinking about this. Two things really stand out, even though they were totally different. Both times, I ended up crying at the end, which is weird for me. First, there was that summer I spent volunteering at an animal shelter after college. I was maybe 22? It felt like a real turning point, like I finally understood what I wanted to do with my life. I remember coming back and just feeling… different.

It’s funny, I remember a professor once talking about how some people just have this way of making you feel like you're the only person in the room. After the shelter, I felt like I could do that too, really listen and connect with people.

Then, more recently, there was the time I had to move back in with my parents after losing my job. Leaving their place again was rough. Not sobbing, but definitely tears. I think it was a mix of relief and… something else. Like, the shelter was when I figured out who I wanted to be, but the time with my parents forced me to confront who I actually was. I was trying so hard to be independent, but I needed them. I think the tears were for the little boy in me, who felt like a failure for needing help from mum and dad.",018
"When you think about close relationships (romantic or deep friendship), how do they tend to make you feel? For example, do they make you feel positive feeling like secure, or comforted? Or do you sometimes feel anxious or like you want to avoid them?","It really depends on who it is. I used to be super close with my cousins, especially Sarah, since we were kids. We'd spend every summer together at my grandma's. Therapists always ask about my family, so I've been thinking about this a lot. With Sarah, it used to be so easy. We just *got* each other. But now... it's different. She got married a few years ago, started focusing on her career, and we just drifted.

When I see her now, I feel this weird mix of guilt and resentment. Guilt because I haven't made more of an effort, and resentment because she seems so… different. Like she’s judging my life choices. She always talks about her perfect house and her promotions at work, and I just feel like I can't relate. I work freelance, I rent a tiny apartment, I don't even want kids. It feels like she looks down on me.

I guess I'm afraid of being judged. It makes me want to pull away, even though part of me misses how close we used to be. I try to avoid talking to her, and when I do, I just put on a brave face and pretend everything is great. But it's not. And it makes me feel so alone. Maybe I'm just not good at maintaining relationships.",020
Did your experience with 'The only girl you ever loved' impact subsequent romantic relationships?,"I've only had a couple of relationships since... well, since *her*. And they barely count. I think the first was... I met someone at a bookstore, maybe a year or so ago. She was really into fantasy novels, which was cool, but I just felt like I was going through the motions. I kept thinking about how [ex's name] would have made fun of the books, but in a loving way, you know? This new girl was just… nice. Too nice, maybe. I ended things after a month.

Then, a few months later, I went on a few dates with someone I met through a hiking group. We had amazing conversations on the trail, really deep stuff. But then, back in the real world, it just fizzled. I kept comparing her to [ex's name]'s sense of adventure and spontaneity. It wasn't fair, but I couldn't help it. I sabotaged things before they even started. I told her I wasn't ready for a relationship, which was partly true, but mostly just an excuse. I guess I'm afraid of getting hurt again, so I push people away. It's easier that way, even though it sucks.",021
What differences do you notice in your relationships when there is 'geographic distance' between you?,"It's funny, distance really affects my relationships. I used to think it was just me, that I wasn't good at keeping in touch if I didn't see people regularly. I remember when my cousin, Mark, moved to Vancouver for a few years. We were super close growing up, practically brothers. He left, and… silence. Years later, he came back for Christmas. We bumped into each other at the holiday party. The conversation was something like: Him: ""Hey, long time no see!"" Me: ""Yeah, what's up?"" Him: ""Not much, same old."" It was like he'd just popped out to the store.

I guess it was easier when everyone was single and looking for company. Now, everyone's got families and their own lives. I threw myself into my job for a while, didn't really make an effort with anyone outside of work. After that ended, I realized I hadn't nurtured those friendships. Then my dad got sick, and things got even more complicated. He needed so much care, and it felt like it isolated me from the rest of the family. I felt like I was the only one who truly understood what he needed, and that created a rift. Now, the distance feels permanent, even when people are physically close.",022
"You alluded to some conflict in your family, how do you go about repairing relationships after conflict?","I don't usually have big conflicts with people. I tend to avoid it. It feels like a waste of energy. I guess that comes from my need to control things, conflict feels unpredictable.

I had a falling out with a close friend recently, after we started a small business together. We had different ideas about how to run things and I got frustrated because I felt like they weren't taking it seriously enough. I ended up saying some harsh things, questioning their commitment, which I regret.

Now, I'm not sure how to fix it. I feel like I should apologize, but part of me is still angry and feels justified. It's like, if they had just listened to me in the first place, none of this would have happened. I know that's not entirely fair, but it's hard to let go of that feeling. I'm worried that if I apologize, it will be seen as weakness, or that they won't accept it anyway. Maybe it's better to just let it go, but then I'll feel guilty. It's a lose-lose.",023
Give a gut score and a one‑line example for each of the below: Openness (ideas/novelty): /7 → example Conscientiousness (order/plan/finish): /7 → example Extraversion (energy from people): /7 → example Agreeableness (cooperative/empathic): /7 → example Neuroticism (baseline reactivity): /7 → example,"Here's my take on those scales:

Openness (ideas/novelty): 2/7 → I really prefer sticking to what I know. I’m not one for change.

Conscientiousness (order/plan/finish): 3/7 → I try to be organized, but things usually fall apart. Like with the garden project last spring. I *meant* to plan it all out, but I just bought a bunch of seeds and hoped for the best. Ended up with weeds everywhere.

Extraversion (energy from people): 7/7 → I thrive in big groups! I love being the center of attention, making people laugh. If I'm not the most popular person in the room, I feel like something is wrong.

Agreeableness (cooperative/empathic): 2/7 → I have a really hard time seeing other people's points of view, especially if I disagree with them. I tend to think my way is the *right* way.

Neuroticism (baseline reactivity): 6/7 → I worry constantly. About everything. The smallest thing can send me spiraling. Like the other day, my neighbor didn't wave back and I was convinced she hates me and everyone else does too. I tend to catastrophize a lot of things.",024
"Please list your top 5 core values that you actually trade on in real decisions. Do you find yourself facing any tough trade-off's between them? It's fine if some of these cross over into the 'Top 3 rules to live by that we discussed earlier.""","1. Family, 2. Financial Security, 3. Independence, 4. Social Status, 5. Novelty. I guess those are my top values, roughly in order.

It's hard when these clash. Like, Family vs. Financial Security: My parents expect me to take over the family business, but it's dying. Staying would mean sacrificing my financial future, and my own family's later on. I feel guilty even thinking about leaving, like I'm abandoning them, but is that *actually* helping anyone in the long run?

Independence vs. Family and Social Status: My folks have a very specific idea of who I should be – successful, married, living nearby. But I crave independence. I want to travel, explore different careers. If I do that, I risk disappointing them and losing my place in our social circle. It's like, either I'm true to myself and potentially alone, or I conform and resent everyone. I know I shouldn't think in extremes, but it feels that way. I try to tell myself that I am being independent by making my own decisions, but I still struggle to believe it sometimes, and it can feel like I am just lying to myself to make myself feel better.",025
"What reliably shifts you into high arousal or low mood states (sleep loss, heat, injustice, seeing suffering, bureaucratic stonewalling, etc.)? What are your first bodily/cognitive tells (tight jaw, tunnel vision, rapid ideation, time‑urgency thoughts, etc.)?","High Arousal: ""Deadlines"" trigger this a lot. I get super focused, almost like I'm in a video game – enhanced awareness of what needs doing, prioritizing tasks like a checklist in my head. My shoulders tense up, and I start thinking really fast about how to optimize everything. ""Unexpected changes at work"" also do it. Similar response, but with more frustration. I'll clench my fists and internally rehearse different responses to the situation. Music helps sometimes; I'll put on something loud and fast to channel the energy. My colleagues joke I look like I'm about to explode. It helps me to concentrate.

Low Mood: ""Criticism,"" even constructive, hits hard. I tend to withdraw and replay the feedback in my head, picking it apart. My face gets hot, and I feel a sinking feeling in my chest. My husband says I get this ""lost puppy"" look. Seeing animals in distress gets to me too. I'll avoid news stories about it, but if I accidentally see something, I'll feel down for the rest of the day. I try to tell myself that there are people helping these animals, but it doesn't always work.",026
